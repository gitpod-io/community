## How community highlights work

Every two weeks the Gitpod community team curate the various activities that happen in the community.

If we miss one of your contributions that you'd like to highlight, feel free to raise a PR.

### Guidelines

When making a submission...

- Make sure you are clear and concise
- Link the contributor, using either their username on platform they originally posted from. If in doubt, use any handle you find.
- Use ` ` to highlight contributor names
- Try not to use emojis to help it easier to read
- If there are multiple sources, use the
  `[[1]](LINK) [[2]](LINK)` format
- Use **bold** and _italics_ sparringly

For example:

- [`@pawlean`](https://www.twitter.com/paulienuh) hosted [a community event in Paris.](https://guild.host/gitpod)
- [`@axonasif`](https://www.twitter.com/axonasif) created several new contributions to `gitpod-samples` [[1]](https://github.com/gitpod-samples) [[2]](https://github.com/gitpod-samples)
- [`@ghostdevv`](https://twitter.com/onlyspaceghost) supported the [**exciting meet-up in London**](https://twitter.com/onlyspaceghost/status/1691560381116752161)!
