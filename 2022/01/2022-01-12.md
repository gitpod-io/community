# Questions

**Q1. What exactly is werft and why does it want me to shorten the branch names of my PRs to the gitpod repo (branch names that usually get generated by Gitpod itself)?**

[Notion â€“ The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/How-we-develop-e8ce7e562478458a9223eb9b797415b2#8b30208f6da14dcc81a87a6c09fde2f7)

[werft - just Kubernetes-native CI](https://werft.dev/)

The branch names need to be shortened (this is how werft works), best practice is to change your branch name.

This should be included in our contributing docs. This is the issue capturing it [here.](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6466)

**Q2. What is the process of getting bugs and feature requests seen by Gitpod?**

We run an internal process using Front which manages all the communication from the community, this included GitHub issues and feature requests. From our conversation, we discovered that we need to investigate what was happening to GitHub Issues not having any comments or feedback from Gitpodders. Pauline checked this out and fixed an automation issue that we had on Front, so now we should be able to capture ALL requests better.

It was also suggested that feature requests should be discussed in Discord. The channel #feature-requests was created on Discord as a space for people to talk about ideas and improvements, we still recommend that you raise a feature request the usual way through [GitHub](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod).
