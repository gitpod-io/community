# Community Office Hour: 2022-01-26

**What was covered:**

- A showcase from AXON on workspace-images (demo coming soon!)
- AMA

## AMA

**Q: Is there any big feature / change being worked on right now? If it's secret, just tell us that it exists üò¨**

Always üôèüèº

The biggest thing we're working on is improvements on [Jetbrains integration and docs](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/editors) and [SSH Gateway](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/7412)

**Q: Can we run Kubernetes in Gitpod?**

It can get quite meta and confusing because Gitpod in itself is running in Kubernetes! You can run Kubernetes in Gitpod.

Pauline noted that she has run simple Kubernetes commands to create pods for example practising Kubernetes.

**Q: There was some kind of standardize file for configuration Cloud Developer Environments (outside of Gitpod), that I remember being on the Gitpod Roadamp for Q4 2021. Is this still happening?**

Issue to watch out for: https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7721

**Q: How can we proritise community feedback?**

This question comes up every week (with variations). We hae started to see that there are plenty of areas our community wants us to proritise. _Action:_ Pauline has created an internal document that creates a place to throw key issues our community is facing. A process to get these proritised needs to be discussed internally.
