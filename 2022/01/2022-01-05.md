# Community Office Hour: 2022-01-05

**What was covered:**

- Welcome back and happy new year! ðŸŽ‰
- Casual AMA

**Q1: Per workspace basis? So 2 workspaces that are opened means Iâ€™m billed twice?**
**Q2: Is this per second basis or per minute?**

Yes, it is per workspace and counted by the second

**Q: Given that docker would be charging starting from next year, is there something gitpod users need to do?**

Nothing you need to do as Gitpod users!

**Q: The logic behind incremental prebuilds (how they determined which previous prebuild layer can be reused), the secrets of what is happening while we wait for a workspace to load**

> FYI, if you're interested, here is the incremental prebuild logic. It's a bit lacking in explanatory comments (ðŸ˜¬) but it basically describes how Gitpod "walks back" the commit history in order to find a compatible prebuild, and what exactly "compatible" means (should be successful, should not be incremental itself (because we don't want infinite chains of prebuilds based on prebuilds), should still have the same image and the same init tasks, etc)

**Q: What is gp snapshot?**
Gitpod CLI for using Gitpod snapshots. This can also be done through the UI [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/sharing-and-collaboration).

**Q: Where can we read what are the next major features coming to Gitpod in this/next quarter?**

Our roadmap is public ðŸŽ‰ We're still in the process of organising ourselves for Q1 2022, watch this space.

**Q: How do you enable remote Live Share on a gitpod?**

This is not possible in the browser version of Gitpod but should work in VS Code Desktop support. Alternatively, you can also collaborate by sharing your workspace. Docs[here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/sharing-and-collaboration).
