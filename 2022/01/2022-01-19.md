**What was covered:**

- A demo on Project Environment Variables (https://www.gitpod.io/docs/environment-variables#project-specific-environment-variables)
- Community questions

## Community Questions

_Q: When a project needs to be HIPAA compliance (for working on healthcare projects in USA), or other goverment requirements, is there a plan/timeline for when Gitpod can host projects like these?_

We do not plan this currently. However, we do not necessarily collect HIPAA relevant data in the first place but there is also the self-hosted option clients can use to stay compliant with HIPAA.

It's also worth checking out: https://www.gitpod.io/security

_Q: How can we keep up with all the new things Gitpod is shipping?_

Our changelog is the best place for that! We recently set up the automation so it updates every 2 weeks.

_Q: what does Gitpod expects from the community: solve more issues? help on the features? other?_
You can find out how you can contribute to the community more here:

_Q: I got invitation to Github Copilot preview and I was not able to install copilot extension on Gitpod. Is copilot extension going to be supported?_

If you open Gitpod in your local VS Code, you can use Copilot! This currently isn't supported in the browser.

_Q: Do you have like a public roadmap?_
Yes!
