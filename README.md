# Gitpod Community Office Hours

We started hosting weekly Community Office Hours on our [community Discord server.](https://www.gitpod.io/chat) Also see [the internal RFC](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/Gitpod-Community-Office-Hours-e85cc0d0a92644409635956292bf6b01) on this proposal.

As we wanted to make sure that these office hours are as inclusive and a safe space as possible, we do not record them. However, we will always have folks writing notes throughout and this is where they will live!

Feel free to raise a PR if you took notes of your own and want to add it here. ðŸ§¡
