# Gitpod Community Office Hours

We started hosting weekly Community Office Hours on our [community Discord server.](https://www.gitpod.io/chat) Also see [the internal RFC](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/Gitpod-Community-Office-Hours-e85cc0d0a92644409635956292bf6b01) on this proposal.

## Getting started

If you join one of our office hours, this is what you can expect.

There is never any pressure for you to switch your mic or camera on, you can just listen in the background. In some cases, moderators mute you if you accidentally unmute yourself and someone else is talking.

There is an accompanying `#office-hours-text` where you can type responses/questions there if you'd prefer.

## Don't miss our next Gitpod Community Hour!

As we wanted to make sure that these office hours are as inclusive and a safe space as possible, we do not record them. However, we will always have folks writing notes throughout and this is where they will live!

Feel free to raise a PR if you took notes of your own and want to add it here. ðŸ§¡
