# Gitpod Community Office Hours

We host bi-weekly Community Office Hours on Wednesday at 5:30PM CET ([What time is that where you live? Check here!](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211216T163000&p1=tz_gmt&p2=tz_cet&p3=tz_pt&p4=240)) on our [community Discord server.](https://www.gitpod.io/chat)

Also see [the internal RFC](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/Gitpod-Community-Office-Hours-e85cc0d0a92644409635956292bf6b01) on this proposal.

As we wanted to make sure that these office hours are as inclusive and a safe space as possible, we do not record them. However, we will always have folks writing notes throughout and this is where they will live!

Feel free to raise a PR if you took notes of your own and want to add it here. üß°

üìù There is never any pressure for you to switch your mic or camera on, you can just listen in the background.

üí¨ There is an accompanying `#office-hours-text` where you can type responses/questions there if you'd prefer.

üö´ In some cases, moderators mute you if you accidentally unmute yourself and someone else is talking.

‚ùì Have a question? Drop them over at `#office-hours-text` before our next session or feel free to raise an issue in this repo!
