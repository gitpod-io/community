## Installer Demo

<https://github.com/MrSimonEmms/gitpod-installer-demo>

## Self-hosted-specific questions

**Q: How is this different to self-hosted guides?**

The Installer is used to install/upgrade Gitpod. It first came about as an internal RFC to solve the problem of how complicated it can get installing/upgrading Gitpod which causes friction in the SaaS development/deployment process and releasing self-hosted. This is still evolving!

Self-hosted guides create the infrastructure in X cloud service. See the docs for that [here.](<https://www.gitpod.io/docs/self-hosted/latest/installation>)

**Q: Are we still on track for planned self-hosted licensing changes to officially land alongside the new installer with version 0.11.0? Related to that, any updates on charging only for "active users"?**

Improving our self-hosted licensing is a focus in Q1 2022. Please follow [this issue.](<https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5690>) Suggestions by the community included checking out [Terraform's](<https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing>) pricing model for Enterprise customers.

## Questions from the community

**Q: Incremental prebuilds - how does it work, how different it is from regular prebuilds?**

Changelog "announcement": <https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/faster-incremental-prebuilds>

We need to get this documented!

**Q: Project-environment-variables and public repos.**

No update on this issue. But keep an eye out! <https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/4456>

**Q: Is "being public" something that's well ingrained and accepted, leaving only room for improvement, or are there like recurring doubts / chances that it's going to change anytime soon? w do you live the experience of working in public, being transparent? Any enlightening moments you'd like to share?**

We're definitely not moving away from being in public! But there are aspects perhaps internally that we need to do a bit more of these sorts of things to show off what we do in public.

**Q: I miss zsh (and my local config!) on my Gitpod workspaces: is work on <https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/5198> going well / any spoilers?**

Nothing else apart from everything shared in that issue. We would love it too! ðŸ’œ
